          <div class="quote">Being part of the ASES Manila Summit 2014 has been a truly life changing experience for me. The summit has changed my perception of what entrepreneurship can be in it's truest sense when aimed at helping our fellow beings. It was a wonderful experience visiting the Gawad Kalinga Enchanted farm and being given a chance to interact with great minds like Tony Meloto and Dado Banatao, still cherish these moments. The best part of the summit were the friends I made, the summit was only for a week but the friends are for a lifetime. </div>
